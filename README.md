## Reflection
The development process was complex, but having a plan (planning board) made it easier to be organized and smooth but every file (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) had different challenges.
Working with HTML, having to figure out how to organize and wrap different elements in their containers was not difficult, but still giving some problems when trying to organize the container and their content.
With CSS looking at the small details like the "CYAN" line behind the cards and the logos over the cards was a challenge that took some time to realize how to make it work. When trying to do the line I found the "::before" pseudo-element, an element that in this case was used to insert content (the line) before the actual content of a selected HTML element(the cards).
With JavaScript, API fetching and error handling was the most challenging parts that I faced.
Documentation and "video tutorials" were a good resource to overcome all the challenges faced for each file, also, testing the after writing new code was key for the whole project.
